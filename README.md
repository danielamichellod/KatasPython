# üêç KatasPython
This repository contains a collection of logic katas in Python, designed to practice core programming skills including control structures, lambda functions, error handling, functional programming, and object-oriented programming.

## Description of the project
The objective of this project is to solve a series of Python exercises ("katas") that apply and reinforce all the key programming concepts covered in the Logic and Python Fundamentals module.

The exercises are presented in the document titled **"PROYECTO L√ìGICA: Katas de Python"**.

Throughout the module, we studied the following concepts:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Recursion
- Loops
- Exception handling
- Functional programming with `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `lambda`
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project serves as a practical summary of the module, allowing us to apply logic and programming techniques to a wide range of real-life scenarios.

## Structure of the project
```bash
KatasPython/
|--1. KatasPython.py # Python file 
|--2. KatasPython.ipynb # Jupyter file
|--EnunciadoDataProjectPython.pdf # The Python statements
|--README.md
```

## Project development
In that part, we describe the process followed to complete the project.

### First step
- To begin, I used a **Jupyter Notebook** to work on the kata statements. Jupyter provided a more intuitive and interactive environment that allowed me to quickly test and visualize the output of each function. This made the debugging process easier and helped ensure each function worked as expected before transferring the final code to a `.py` file.

### Second step
- After verifying the solutions in Jupyter, I migrated the complete and validated code to a structured Python file.

### Third step
- Documented the project and provided a clear explanation in the README file. 

## üìä Summary of the Katas

This project includes 41 logic katas that cover a wide range of Python concepts:

### Examples of covered tasks:

- Frequency analysis of characters in strings
- Data transformation using `map()` and `filter()`
- Recursive calculation (e.g., factorial)
- Exception handling in user input and division
- Average and statistical analysis on lists
- Use of `reduce()` for calculations like total product or concatenation
- Functional operations with lambda functions
- String masking and data anonymization
- Detection of duplicates and filtering based on conditions
- Object-oriented structures for trees and bank user management
- A text processor function that dynamically applies counting, replacement, or deletion
- User-interactive programs involving control flow and conditional logic
- Geometric area calculations based on input shapes

## üìå Key Learnings and Insights

- Improved ability to solve algorithmic problems using Python.
- Mastery of built-in functions and core syntax.
- Clear understanding of how to structure Python scripts and functions.
- Efficient use of functional programming techniques for concise code.
- Practical application of OOP in simulating real-world behaviors (e.g., banking, tree growth).
- Confidence in handling user input and exceptions gracefully.
- Realized the benefits of using **Jupyter Notebooks** as a development and testing environment for learning.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of logic programming in Python. Through these 41 katas, I have strengthened my skills in problem-solving, code organization, and real-world application of Python programming techniques.
